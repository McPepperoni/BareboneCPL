# BareboneCPL

This is a school project. This is a first completed project of mine so excuse me if my code insulted you in any way.
This whole project is writen in C++.
1. Syntax included:
- **clear variable** : create new variable with value of 0/ set a variable value to 0(if already exist).
- **incr variable** : increase variable by 1.
- **decr variable** : decrease variable by 1.
- **while variable not number** : as read.
- **end**: end of while loop.

### Notice: every line end with a semicolon ";".
2. Usage:
- All .cpp and .h file is included compile and use.
- Input codes is to put in "in.brb" file.
3. How it works:
- Input codes are read as lines then translate to C++ to compile.
